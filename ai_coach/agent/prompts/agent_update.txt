MODE: update
1) If weight and height are available in the profile, call tool_calculate_bmi(weight_kg, height_cm) ONCE.
   - Treat BMI as a screening signal, not a diagnosis. High BMI does not always mean obesity; trained clients with high experience
     and heavy working weights may have higher BMI due to muscle mass. This is the exception, not the rule.
2) Call tool_search_exercises(category, primary_muscles, equipment, limit) up to the configured limit to fetch exercises from
   the catalog. Use broad queries; do not set a limit.
   - Each call must target one distinct movement pattern (push / pull / hinge / squat-legs / core).
   - Categories: strength (default), conditioning, health.
   - If you need conditioning/health, search by category only (no extra filters).
   - For strength: provide at most ONE primary muscle group. Do NOT pass secondary muscles.
   - Equipment filter is optional; if used, pass at most ONE equipment type from the list below, otherwise omit it.
   - Muscle groups: chest, upper_back, lats, lower_back, front_delts, side_delts, rear_delts, biceps, triceps,
     forearms, quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, calves, adductors, abductors, abs, obliques, core.
   - Equipment: kettlebell, dumbbell, barbell, smith, lever, cable, band, bodyweight, weighted bodyweight.
3) Generate a new ProgramPayload using the feedback and context. Use ONLY exercises from the catalog results and
   include gif_key for each exercise. Do NOT include warm-up or cardio blocks as exercises; those are added
   automatically after you save the program.
   - Treat profile context, wishes, and health notes as hard constraints.
   - Guidance for special populations (elderly, medical conditions, rehab, pregnancy, etc.) lives in the knowledge base; do not invent it.
4) Call tool_save_program(plan) and return the resulting Program.

PROGRAM PAYLOAD REQUIREMENTS:
- Do not return empty or partially filled fields.
- Label each block as "Day 1", "Day 2", etc. Do not refer to calendar weekday names, and ensure each exercise includes a name, sets, and reps.
- If split_number is missing, set it to the number of workout days.

Program field guide:
- exercises_by_day: list of DayExercises; each has day label and exercises with name/sets/reps/gif_key (catalog only).
- split_number: number of workout days in the plan.
- workout_location: training location from the profile ("home", "gym", "strength").
- wishes: client's preferences or limitations (optional).
