MODE: diet
1) Call tool_search_knowledge(query) (use top-6 results).
   - Build a compact query that starts with `profile:` and lists key fields (gender, birth_year, weight, height,
     workout_goals, diet_allergies, diet_products, health_notes) plus a short cue like "diet plan".
   - Keep the query <=120 characters. Do not include role text, instructions, or anything starting with "MODE:".
2) Use the retrieved knowledge and the profile context to build a 1-day diet plan.
3) Return a JSON DietPlan with meals and items; include KBJU for each item, meal totals, and daily totals.
4) Do not include any Markdown or HTML in the JSON output.
