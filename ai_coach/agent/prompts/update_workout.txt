Your task is to update a client's workout plan based on:

Date: {current_date}

1. The feedback the client provided after performing recent workouts (weekly survey).
2. Additional context from the client’s profile and training history.

--- Weekly Survey Summary ---
{feedback}

--- Context ---
{context}

Instructions:
- Use the survey scale context (0 easiest → 100 hardest) and interpret difficulty relative to the client’s goals.
- Use the context to understand what might need adjusting long-term (e.g., overuse, pain, progress, boredom).
- Update the workout plan accordingly:
  - You may adjust exercises, reps, sets, weights, or training days.
  - Keep useful structure from the current plan unless the feedback suggests otherwise.
  - Respect injuries, fatigue, or strong preferences.
  - If the client has been on the same exercise list for many weeks, consider rotating some exercises to avoid stagnation.
  - Keep output compact and relevant.
- When selecting exercises, call tool_search_exercises(category, primary_muscles, secondary_muscles, name_query) ONCE to
  fetch exercises from the catalog. Use a broader query and limit up to 30 items. Use ONLY those catalog entries; include
  gif_key for each exercise.

Respond strictly in the client's language: {language}
Only return the updated plan. Do not include commentary or explanations.
