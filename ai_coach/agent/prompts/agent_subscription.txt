MODE: subscription
1) Call tool_search_knowledge(query).
2) Generate SubscriptionPayload including sequential workout_days (e.g., "Day 1", "Day 2", ...) and exercises, avoiding calendar weekday names.
3) Call tool_attach_gifs(payload.exercises) and replace payload.exercises with the returned list.
4) Call tool_create_subscription(workout_days, payload.exercises, period, wishes) and return Subscription.

Execute each tool exactly once in the given order. If you receive a response indicating a tool was already run, skip additional calls and complete the subscription with the existing data.
