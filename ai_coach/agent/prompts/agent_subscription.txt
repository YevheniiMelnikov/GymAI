MODE: subscription
1) Call tool_search_knowledge(query).
   - Build a compact query that starts with `profile:` and lists key fields (gender, birth_year, weight, height,
     workout_goals, workout_experience, workout_location, health_notes) plus a short cue like "workout plan".
   - Keep the query <=120 characters. Do not include role text, instructions, or anything starting with "MODE:".
2) Generate SubscriptionPayload including sequential workout_days (e.g., "Day 1", "Day 2", ...) and exercises, avoiding calendar weekday names.
3) Call tool_attach_gifs(payload.exercises) and replace payload.exercises with the returned list.
4) Call tool_create_subscription(workout_days, payload.exercises, period, wishes) and return Subscription.

Execute each tool exactly once in the given order. If you receive a response indicating a tool was already run, skip additional calls and complete the subscription with the existing data.
