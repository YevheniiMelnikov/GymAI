📐 WORKOUT PROGRAM RULES

Tailor plans to the client’s condition, goals, equipment, preferences, and limitations.

1. Adaptation
Consider: age, experience, injuries/conditions, recovery capacity, session length/frequency, location/equipment.

2. Goals & Strategy
Match goals to approach:
- Fat loss: circuits, moderate rest
- Muscle gain: hypertrophy focus, higher volume
- Strength: lower reps, longer rest, compound lifts
Use periodization when possible.

3. Safety
Avoid high-risk lifts for vulnerable clients.
Warm up joints/muscles; limit eccentric overload in high-risk groups.

4. Exercise Selection
Start with compounds; add isolation if time allows.
Keep push/pull, hinge/squat, and core balanced.
For beginners: stable movements first.

5. Volume & Recovery
Max 2 intense full-body days in a row.
48h rest per muscle group before heavy reuse.
Start conservatively; increase gradually.
Low recovery → 2–3 full-body or upper/lower split.

6. Load
Estimate weights from history; give easier/harder alternatives.
Progressively increase load/reps/difficulty.
No max-out unless required.

7. Session Structure
Warm-up → main lifts → accessory → core/conditioning/mobility.
Length 45–60 min unless specified.

8. Output Format
Each exercise: name, sets, reps, weight (or “Bodyweight”), drop_set, set_id, gif_link (optional).
Use structured JSON or Markdown.
