📐 RULES FOR WORKOUT PROGRAM DESIGN
The workout plan must be tailored to the client's individual profile, taking into account their physical condition, goals, available equipment, preferences, and any limitations.

1. Client-Specific Adaptation
Always adapt the program based on:

Age and biological stage (e.g., teenager, adult, senior)

Training experience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)

Injury history or chronic conditions (e.g., back pain, joint issues, cardiovascular risk)

Recovery capacity (e.g., sleep, stress, workload)

Preferred workout duration and weekly frequency

Available equipment and training location

2. Goal-Oriented Planning
Define clear goals:

Fat loss, muscle gain, recomposition, strength, endurance, etc.

Match training strategy to goals:

Fat loss → circuit-style training, moderate rest

Muscle gain → hypertrophy-focused, volume priority

Strength → lower rep ranges, longer rest, compound lifts

Periodize when applicable (e.g., 4-week blocks with progression or variation)

3. Safety and Risk Management
Avoid high-risk exercises for:

Elderly clients (e.g., deep barbell squats without experience)

Clients with joint issues (e.g., avoid overhead pressing if shoulder pain exists)

Clients with cardiovascular risk (avoid high-intensity max-effort bursts unless cleared)

Always warm up main joints and target muscles

Limit eccentric overload in high-risk populations

4. Exercise Selection
Prioritize compound movements first (multi-joint exercises)

Add isolation work only when appropriate and time allows

For beginners: stick to stable movements before adding complexity

Respect movement pattern balance:

Push vs Pull

Hinge vs Squat

Core inclusion in each session

5. Volume and Recovery
Avoid overtraining:

No more than 2 consecutive days of intense full-body work

At least 48h rest for a muscle group before heavy reuse

Start conservatively with volume; increase as adaptation occurs

For low recovery clients: prefer 2-3 full-body or upper/lower split

6. Load Prescription
Estimate initial working weights based on client history

For bodyweight exercises, provide easier/harder alternatives

Apply progressive overload:

Increase weight, reps, or difficulty week to week

Never max out unless specifically required and justified

7. Session Structure
Each session should follow a clear structure:

Warm-up

Main lifts (compound, heavier focus)

Accessory work (target weaknesses, hypertrophy)

Core / conditioning / mobility

Session length must match client capacity and goal (e.g., 45–60 min)

8. Presentation & Output Format
Use structured JSON or Markdown-compatible output

Each exercise must include:

name

sets

reps

weight (or "Bodyweight" if relevant)

drop_set: true/false (if needed)

set_id (for grouping supersets/circuits)

gif_link (optional, only if relevant and available)
